# skippy-junit5

Skippy support for JUnit 5.

## Step 1: Add The skippy-junit5 Dependency

Releases are available in Maven Central:
```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'io.skippy:skippy-junit5:0.0.7'
}
```

Snapshots are available in `s01.oss.sonatype.org`:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'io.skippy:skippy-junit5:0.0.8-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Step 2: Skippify Your Tests
Annotate the tests you want to skippify with `@Skippified`:
```groovy
import io.skippy.junit5.Skippified;

@Skippified
public class FooTest {

    @Test
    void testFoo() {
        assertEquals("hello", Foo.hello());
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Run Your Tests

Skippy intelligently decides whether to execute or skip tests based on data in the skippy folder:

- The data in the skippy folder is generated by [skippy-gradle](../skippy-gradle/README.md)
- The decision-making logic is implemented in [skippy-core](../skippy-core/README.md)` information about the conditional execution at [skippy-core](../skippy-core/README.md)
