# skippy-junit5

Enhance your JUnit 5 testing with Skippy's conditional test execution. 
This guide helps you integrate Skippy into your project for smarter testing.

## Step 1: Add the skippy-junit5 dependency

First, you have to add a dependency to `skippy-junit5`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'io.skippy:skippy-junit5:0.0.4'
}
```

Releases and snapshots can be found at:
```groovy
repositories {
    // releases
    mavenCentral()
    
    // snapshots
    maven { url = 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
}
```

## Step 2: Enable Skippy in Your Test Suite
To use Skippy, annotate your test classes with the Skippy extension:
```groovy
import io.skippy.junit5.Skippy;

@ExtendWith(Skippy.class)
public class FooTest {

    @Test
    void testFoo() {
        assertEquals("hello", Foo.hello());
    }
}
```


## Step 3: Running Tests with Skippy

Skippy intelligently decides whether to execute or skip tests based on analysis data in the skippy folder.
This data is generated using the [skippy-gradle](../skippy-gradle/README.md) plugin.

Let's go over the scenarios that you might encounter. 

Note: The verbose logging in the following examples is generated by setting the
log level for `io.skippy` to `DEBUG`.

### No Analysis Data Found

Without prior analysis data, Skippy defaults to executing tests:
```
./gradlew test

00:00:00.000 [Test worker] DEBUG i.s.c.m.SkippyAnalysisResult - org.example.Test1: No analysis found. Execution required.

Test1 > name() PASSED
```

### No Changes Detected

Skippy skips tests if no changes are detected in tests or covered classes:
```
./gradlew test

00:00:00.000 [Test worker] DEBUG i.s.c.m.SkippyAnalysisResult - org.example.Test1: No changes in test or covered classes detected. Execution skipped.

Test1 > name() SKIPPED
```

### Change in Test Detected

Skippy executes tests if it detects changes in them:
```
./gradlew test

00:00:00.000 [Test worker] DEBUG i.s.c.m.SkippyAnalysisResult - org.example.Test1: Change in test detected. Execution required.

Test1 > name() PASSED
```

### Change in Covered Class Detected

Skippy also executes tests if it detects changes in covered classes:
```
./gradlew test

00:00:00.000 [Test worker] DEBUG i.s.c.m.SkippyAnalysisResult - org.example.Test1: Change in covered class 'org.example.Constant' detected. Execution required.

Test1 > name() PASSED
```
